<header><h1>The Adventure of You!</h1></header>
<h2>You choose to walk through the door.</h2>
<section>You quickly feel yourself getting stuck on something thin. <br>
As you try to get rid of it you get more and more stuck until you cant move at all anymore!<br>
    As your eyes become more used to the darkness you start to make out a figure moving slowly towards you. <br>
    Eventually it's right in front of you and you can clearly make out what it is.
